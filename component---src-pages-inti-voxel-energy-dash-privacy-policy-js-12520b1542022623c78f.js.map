GDPR\n        covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or\n        in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person.\n        Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some\n        examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic\n        data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual\n        orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection Principles include\n        requirements such as:\n      </p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and\n          transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would\n          reasonably expect.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose\n          and it should only be used for that purpose.

They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data\n          be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p> </p>\n\n      <h1>Why is GDPR important?</h1>\n\n      <p>\n        GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect\n        individuals&#39; personal data that they collect and process. It also\n        raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing\n        greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it&#39;s simply the right\n        thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data privacy is\n        very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices\n        in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.\n      </p>\n\n      <p> </p>\n\n      <h1>\n        Individual Data Subject&#39;s Rights - Data Access, Portability and\n        Deletion\n      </h1>\n\n      <p>\n        We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights\n        requirements of GDPR.
